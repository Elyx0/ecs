# @colyseus/ecs

Entity Component System integration for Colyseus.

# TODO

- Update Schema#clone() signature to: `clone(): this;`

## Another ECS Implementation?

`@colyseus/ecs` is just a layer on top of [ECSY](https://github.com/MozillaReality/ecsy) for better integration between `@colyseus/schema` and ECSY.
